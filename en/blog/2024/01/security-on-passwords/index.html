<p>This is the first post in our series on various aspects of
security. Now, we take the first step into the digital world and begin
exploring the universe of passwords.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to imagine that all IT attacks are sophisticated, exploiting
unknown security vulnerabilities (so-called 0-days), or that systems
are not updated to patch known security holes.</p>
<p>In IT attacks, it&rsquo;s typically either excessive exposure of non-exposed
systems or the use of weak and leaked passwords that constitute the
vulnerabilities.</p>

passwords, both for personal use and within companies.</p>
<h2 id="where-the-industry-has-failed">Where the industry has failed</h2>
<p>We believe that the industry as a whole has failed on several fronts,
especially concerning password management.</p>
<h3 id="failure-1-the-concept-of-passwords">Failure 1: The concept of passwords</h3>
<p>The choice of the term <em>password</em> as a concept has proven to be
inadequate. A simple word rarely provides sufficient security and
entropy.</p>
<h3 id="failure-2-password-change-policies">Failure 2: Password change policies</h3>
<p>Many organizations have long relied on the idea that regular password
changes are a security measure. Unfortunately, it often results in
users reusing or marginally modifying their existing passwords.</p>
<h3 id="failure-3-lack-of-education-on-risks">Failure 3: Lack of education on risks</h3>
<p>Not enough education has been provided on the dangers of weak
passwords. Understanding risks, such as reuse and short passwords, is
a fundamental part of effective security training.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-an-individual-do">What can an individual do?</h2>
<p>To enhance security for yourself and your digital interactions,
establish strong habits and routines. A password manager is your best
friend for creating and managing unique and long passwords for each
service.</p>
<p>Having robust routines with a password manager is a skill and habit
that you can transfer to your professional role, reducing the risk of
the company facing similar intrusions.</p>
<p>You should also use multi-factor authentication, especially avoiding
the SMS method when possible.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-this-protect-you-others-and-companies">How does this protect you, others, and companies?</h3>
<p>It allows you to minimize the risk of having your accounts
<em>hacked</em>. This is something you hear about relatively often from
ordinary people. Hacked accounts are not only laborious and
inconvenient for you as the victim.</p>
<p>It is also a security risk for others, as your hacked accounts can
lead to the spread of malware and disinformation. The latter is
emphasized by the <a href="https://www.mpf.se/">Swedish Civil Contingencies
Agency</a> in its campaign <a href="https://www.bliintelurad.se/">Don&rsquo;t Get
Fooled</a>, as it contributes to national
security. The fact that your vulnerable social media account can post
disinformation also increases the credibility of the misinformation,
posing a significant risk.</p>
<p>Good routines with a password manager are a knowledge and routine that
you can bring into your work, contributing to better password hygiene
within the company and thus reducing the risks for the company to face
similar intrusions.</p>
