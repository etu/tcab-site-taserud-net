## Websites
The hosting solution we provide is built on the following principles:
- **Security** - Ensuring security for both you as a customer and the
  end-users by keeping servers updated and delivering all websites via
  HTTPS.

- **Mobile-responsive websites** - All the websites we build are
  designed to function on mobile phones, computers, and tablets.

- **Static websites** - This means that the websites cannot be changed
  dynamically by logging into a portal. It provides excellent
  protection against IT attacks.

- **No cookies** - You won't have annoying elements on your website
  asking for permission to store cookies. This makes your website
  GDPR-compliant by default, without extra effort.

- **Accessibility** - We always strive to design websites that are
  easy for people with disabilities, such as blindness or color
  blindness, to navigate.
