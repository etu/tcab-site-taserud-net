In a digital era where information speed is crucial, the choice of a
web platform is critical. Some have taken a step back in time to use
so-called static websites, but not everyone has discovered the
benefits of static sites yet.

This is not really something new; it's essentially what we had before
we started with dynamically generated websites over 20 years
ago. However, there are relatively new tools to make static websites
better and easier than they were 20 years ago.

Static websites are often a better choice than dynamic ones, and we
will go through some of the reasons we see below.

Contact us if you're interested to build a static website or need help
to build one and to host it. [Contact us here](/en/#contact).

## Advantages
Here, we explore the advantages we see with static websites.

### Faster loading times
With a static website, it's often easier to reason about what you
include, giving you a different overview of the various things you
add.  This usually leads to static websites generally containing fewer
unnecessary resources or unnecessary calls to third parties.

This contributes to building a lightweight website with shorter
loading times for the user, resulting in a better user experience.
Especially on poor connections, such as mobile phones.

### Works on all devices
It's a common misconception that static websites are not flexible or
adaptable. This is an unfortunate interpretation of the word "static"
in this context.

Static websites are only static in how content is updated, not in how
it is displayed to the user. They are essentially as flexible for the
end-user as a dynamic website regarding the devices they work on,
scaling from mobile phones to computers.

### Server security
Since there are no dynamic components that need to run on the server
side, the attack vector on the server decreases significantly, making
it much easier to secure the server.

### User security
A secure server makes it much easier to make it safe for the user as
well. A server that has been compromised can start spreading malicious
content to its users. Therefore, it's important to have a secure
server to protect the website's users.

### Server performance
One of the advantages of static websites compared to dynamic ones is
that they don't need to be calculated in real-time on every
visit. Instead, all calculations are done in advance. This leads to
less load on hosting and can accommodate more users at lower server
costs for you.

### Easier server management
The backup process becomes trivial for servers that only have static
websites on them, as you don't need to keep track of complicated
states.  Everything needed to recreate the websites is strictly
defined in a project, and you can recreate the entire website from
that project.

## Limitations
The absolute biggest limitations lie in the static nature, which
doesn't suit all use cases.

Areas where it may not fit include:
- Websites changed by visitors in any way.
- E-commerce where you need to update inventory when purchases are
  made.
- Websites with login functionality.
- Websites that strictly require an embedded contact form.

Despite these limitations, there are things you can do to automate
content replenishment from external sources if needed for that
specific requirement.

## Conclusion
Despite these limitations, we want to emphasize that we believe static
websites suit many more than those currently using them, including
businesses that may not think it would fit.

Businesses where I see great potential for static websites:
- All types of websites that are primarily contact information.
- All types of restaurants without built-in booking systems and a menu
  that doesn't change very often.
- All types of businesses where there is static information, such as
  opening hours, phone numbers, addresses, and similar, to find the
  business's physical location.
