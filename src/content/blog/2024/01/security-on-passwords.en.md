This is the first post in our series on various aspects of
security. Now, we take the first step into the digital world and begin
exploring the universe of passwords.

It's easy to imagine that all IT attacks are sophisticated, exploiting
unknown security vulnerabilities (so-called 0-days), or that systems
are not updated to patch known security holes.

In IT attacks, it's typically either excessive exposure of non-exposed
systems or the use of weak and leaked passwords that constitute the
vulnerabilities.

passwords, both for personal use and within companies.

## Where the industry has failed
We believe that the industry as a whole has failed on several fronts,
especially concerning password management.

### Failure 1: The concept of passwords
The choice of the term *password* as a concept has proven to be
inadequate. A simple word rarely provides sufficient security and
entropy.

### Failure 2: Password change policies
Many organizations have long relied on the idea that regular password
changes are a security measure. Unfortunately, it often results in
users reusing or marginally modifying their existing passwords.

### Failure 3: Lack of education on risks
Not enough education has been provided on the dangers of weak
passwords. Understanding risks, such as reuse and short passwords, is
a fundamental part of effective security training.

## What can an individual do?
To enhance security for yourself and your digital interactions,
establish strong habits and routines. A password manager is your best
friend for creating and managing unique and long passwords for each
service.

Having robust routines with a password manager is a skill and habit
that you can transfer to your professional role, reducing the risk of
the company facing similar intrusions.

You should also use multi-factor authentication, especially avoiding
the SMS method when possible.

### How does this protect you, others, and companies?
It allows you to minimize the risk of having your accounts
*hacked*. This is something you hear about relatively often from
ordinary people. Hacked accounts are not only laborious and
inconvenient for you as the victim.

It is also a security risk for others, as your hacked accounts can
lead to the spread of malware and disinformation. The latter is
emphasized by the [Swedish Civil Contingencies
Agency](https://www.mpf.se/) in its campaign [Don't Get
Fooled](https://www.bliintelurad.se/), as it contributes to national
security. The fact that your vulnerable social media account can post
disinformation also increases the credibility of the misinformation,
posing a significant risk.

Good routines with a password manager are a knowledge and routine that
you can bring into your work, contributing to better password hygiene
within the company and thus reducing the risks for the company to face
similar intrusions.
